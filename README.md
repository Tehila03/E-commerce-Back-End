# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

## Description

My challenge this week was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I was given a working Express.js API and instructed to configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Testing was completed in Insomnia. The application will not be deployed, so a video walkthrough is provided below.
